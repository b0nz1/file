Summary:
This is a subfield of Sentiment Analysis which aims at assigning polarities either Negative, Positive or Neutral to Human genereted content (texts in our case).
Emotion detection seeks to extract finer-grained emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear and so on, from human languages. 
Emotions are derived from the personal experience of individuals and provide insight to their current state and well-being (very important!).
Discrete emotion models (DEMs): The discrete model of emotions involves placing emotions into distinct classes or categories. 
The Paul Ekman model distinguishes emotions based on six basic categories - happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear. 
However, the synergy of these emotions could produce other complex emotions such as guilt, shame, pride, lust, greed, and so on. 
According to Robert Plutchik's model, there are eight emotions in opposite pairs - joy vs sadness, trust vs disgust, anger vs fear, and surprise vs anticipation.
Dimensional emotion models (DiEMs): The dimensional model presupposes that emotions are not independent and that there exists a relation between them hence the need
to place them in a spatial space. 

Most ED is done on other domains (visual, speech) because of difficulties associated with extracting emotions from grammatically erroneous texts, short‐messages, 
sarcasm in written documents, contextual information, and so on. The task of determining the appropriate relation under which an author can be significantly 
associated with their written texts in order to determine their emotions could be backbreaking.

Datasets: The paper contains 13 publicly available datasets for text-based ED in domains of twits, articles, comments. One database is in arabic as well:
The Semantic Evaluations (SemEval) is a database consisting of Arabic and English news headlines extracted from news websites such as BBC, CNN, Google News, and 
other major newspapers. The dataset contains 1250 data in total. The data in this database are rich in emotional content for emotion extraction and it is labeled 
using the 6 emotional categories (ie, joy, sadness, fear, surprise, anger, and disgust) presented by Ekman.

options:
1. ED based on speech (before transcript)
2. text-based ED with public datasets + translations (multilingual caipability...)

* Published a pretrained hebrew BERT on the task of sentiment analysis with the following results:
natural	0.83	0.56	0.67
positive	0.96	0.92	0.94
negative	0.97	0.99	0.98
accuracy			0.97
macro avg	0.92	0.82	0.86
weighted avg	0.96	0.97	0.96

* Supposed to publish Emotion Recognition model as well. I opened an issue regarding the model and the data it was trained on.
DATASET: UGC (User Generated Content) ~150 MB, including over 7 millions words and 350K sentences. 
~2000 sentences were annotated by crowd members (3-10 annotators per sentence) for overall sentiment (polarity) 
and eight emotions: anger, disgust, expectation , fear, happy, sadness, surprise and trust.
