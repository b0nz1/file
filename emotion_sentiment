accuracy			0.97
macro avg	0.92	0.82	0.86
weighted avg	0.96	0.97	0.96

* Supposed to publish Emotion Recognition model as well. I opened an issue regarding the model and the data it was trained on.
DATASET: UGC (User Generated Content) ~150 MB, including over 7 millions words and 350K sentences. 
~2000 sentences were annotated by crowd members (3-10 annotators per sentence) for overall sentiment (polarity) 
and eight emotions: anger, disgust, expectation , fear, happy, sadness, surprise and trust.
